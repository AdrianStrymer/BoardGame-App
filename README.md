+ GET /thing/{partition-key}/ - Get all the 'things' with a specified partition key.
+ GEtT/thing/{partition-key}?attributeX=value - Get all the 'things' with a specified partition key value and attributeX satisfying the condition .....

### Update constraint (if relevant).

[Briefly explain your design for the solution to the PUT/Update constraint 
- only the user who added an item to the main table could update it.]
